"""Pose the robot by hand in MuJoCo's viewer.

A scratchpad for "what does this joint actually do" and for building a pose by
eye. Separate from ``view_default_pose.py``, which is a check -- it asserts one
specific pose. Nothing here is authoritative about what training spawns in.

Time never advances. The viewer is the full `simulate` GUI, but the physics
thread driving it is ours and only ever calls ``mj_forward``, so the robot
cannot fall, sag, or be dragged back to zero by its actuators. It opens at the
configured init_state pose and only what you drag moves.

  - Sliders: right-hand panel, "Joint" section. Tab / Shift-Tab toggle the
    left and right panels.
  - The play/pause button and Space do nothing here, by design. To watch the
    pose actually behave, use ``view_default_pose.py --physics``.

  Neither public entry point can do this. `launch_passive` leaves the joint
  sliders read-only -- editable sliders are a property of the *managed* GUI,
  which is what the `run_physics_thread=True` argument below selects. `launch`
  gives editable sliders but starts its loop running, and `Simulate.run` is a
  read-only property, so there is no way to ask it to start paused.

  What is left is to keep the managed GUI and swap out only the loop behind it:
  `mj_forward` instead of `mj_step`, which is exactly what MuJoCo's own loop
  does while paused (see `viewer._physics_loop`) -- it recomputes kinematics so
  a dragged slider redraws, without integrating time.
